Project Overview



  You are now working with Transplant Wizard - a HIPAA-compliant healthcare platform that connects kidney dialysis

  patients with transplant centers.



  What it does:

  - iOS patient app (SwiftUI) for registration, consent signing, and transplant center selection

  - Node.js backend API for authentication, data management, and referral processing

  - Web portals for Dialysis Unit Social Workers (DUSWs) and Transplant Centers

  - PostgreSQL database on AWS RDS

  - Infrastructure on AWS (EC2, VPC, SES for email)



  Your First Task: Project Analysis



  Read this file first: WINDSURF_INSTRUCTIONS.md (at repo root)



  This document contains:

  - ✅ What the repo is

  - ✅ High-level architecture diagram

  - ✅ Documentation index ("Start Here" section)

  - ✅ All important code files with paths

  - ✅ How to run locally (summary)

  - ✅ How to deploy to EC2 (summary)

  - ✅ Key product flows (implemented & planned)

  - ✅ Secrets/credentials policy

  - ✅ API endpoints quick reference



  Critical Documents



  After reading WINDSURF_INSTRUCTIONS.md, review these in order:



  1. docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md - READ THIS BEFORE ANY DATABASE WORK

    - Complete schema with all tables and relationships

    - Current production status (verified 2025-12-21)

    - Critical for understanding data structure

  2. docs/ARCHITECTURE.md - Understand system design

    - Component overview

    - Data flows

    - Entry points for each service

  3. docs/SETUP.md - How to run locally if needed

  4. docs/DEPLOYMENT.md - If deploying changes to EC2



  Secrets & Credentials



  Important: All credentials are encrypted in .secrets/secrets.enc



  To access them, follow instructions in docs/AGENT_SETUP.md:

  openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -pbkdf2 -in .secrets/secrets.enc -out .secrets/secrets.txt -pass

  pass:TransplantWizard2024

  cat .secrets/secrets.txt

  rm .secrets/secrets.txt



  Never commit credentials to git - they're already gitignored.
