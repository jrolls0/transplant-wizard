I want you to create an IOS mobile app and a website  that will simplify and automate a current process within the existing transplant referral process. Everything that is built in the platform must be COMPLETELY HIPPA compliant (this platform will be sold to medical offices/hospitals who require HIPPA compliant software). Here is the process that I want this platform to be able to handle/automate:
1. Platforms & Technology
iOS Mobile App
Target: iOS 14 and above
Native implementation in Swift
Web Application
Responsive front-end (e.g. React or Vue.js)
Back-end API (e.g. Node.js/Express or Python/Flask)
Cloud & Compliance
Host ALL user data (usernames, passwords, patient info, DUSW info, etc…) on a HIPAA-compliant cloud (AWS)
Encrypt all PHI in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256)
Audit logging for all PHI access
2. Security & Authentication
User Authentication
Secure username/password using AWS cognito
Password reset via secure, time-limited links
Data Protection
Role-based access control (patients vs. DUSWs)
Automatic session timeout after inactivity
3. User Roles
Dialysis Unit Social Worker (DUSW) – uses the website
Patient – uses the iOS mobile app
4. DUSW Website (Social Worker Portal)
Step 0 – Registration & Profile Setup on an initial login screen
Form fields (required):
Title
First Name
Last Name
Phone Number
Email
Secure Username & Password
Data Storage:
All information stored on a HIPAA-compliant, highly secure cloud database
Post-Registration UI:
Visually appealing, professional medical aesthetic
Tabs for:
Dashboard (overview of referred patients)
Patient Referrals (list and status)
Notifications
Settings (profile, password)
5. Patient Mobile App
Step 1 – Registration & Consent (include an initial login/registration screen)
Form fields (required):
Title
First Name
Last Name
Address
Birthdate
Phone Number
Email
Primary Care Physician
Insurance Provider
Secure Username & Password
Data Storage:
All information stored on a HIPAA-compliant, highly secure cloud database
Dialysis Clinic & Referrer Selection (before Consent step):
Dialysis Clinic (dropdown – choose one):
Metro Health Dialysis Center
Lakeside Renal Unit
Grand River Kidney Care
Social Worker (dropdown – appears after clinic selection):
Metro Health Dialysis Center
Sarah Johnson
Michael Lee
Lakeside Renal Unit
Nancy Davis
Robert Smith
Grand River Kidney Care
Emily Chen
Daniel Martinez
Store the patient’s chosen clinic and social worker in their profile record, and associate that social worker’s user account with the patient.
Consent & Release of Information
When: On first sign-up only
What to show: the following document:
“AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF MEDICAL RECORDS
I hereby authorize OrganOptima LLC to release/disclose my medical records.
I understand that I may revoke this authorization at any time in writing.”
How to capture consent:
Render a single-line text input under the document, labeled
“Type your full name to sign” (required).
Render a button labeled
“Confirm Authorization”.
On tap “Confirm Authorization”:
Validate that the input is non-empty.
Save the entered name as the patient’s “signature” along with the current date/time.
Mark both “Consent to communicate PHI” and “Release of Information” as completed in the user’s record.
Proceed to the next step in onboarding
6. Patient Portal & Chatbot
Step 2 – Homepage & Virtual Coordinator
After signup and ROI signature, show a medical-style dashboard with a chatbot widget.
Chatbot Initial Prompt & Selection Form (exact content below; do not modify):
““I’m Amelia, your virtual transplant coordinator. To begin your transplant referral process, please review the list of nearby transplant centers below and choose up to three by replying with their corresponding numbers. Once you’ve made your selections, I’ll contact those centers on your behalf to express your interest and get you next steps.

7. Notifications & Workflow
Step 3 – DUSW Notification
Trigger: As soon as the patient submits their transplant-center selections and confirms authorization
Target: Send a real-time notification to the social worker’s website account that the patient selected during registration
Payload should include:
Confirmation that the patient downloaded the app and completed their profile (automatic)
List of selected transplant centers
Proof of the signed ROI
UX: On the DUSW dashboard the social worker sees a new alert/entry for that patient, with all above details and a link to open or download the ROI document.

NOTE: If there is anything that you need to provide for you (e.g. account IDs, API keys, etc…) make sure to explicitly request the information from me and also provide explanations on how I can obtain the requested information. Likewise, if there are any actions you cannot perform yourself, and you need me to perform those actions on your behalf, then make sure to specifically provide me detailed instructions on what you need me to do for you in order to successfully build the project.
